# MAXREFDES1277
The MAXREFDES1277 reference design enables quick evaluation of MAX17853/52 for battery 
management in a 48V system. It can be used to test IC capabilities such as measurements, Cell balancing 
and alerts using UART and SPI communications.

The MAXREFDES1277 consists of:
- MAX17852 BMS IC
- 2 x MAX17841 for Dual UART
- MAXREFDES1277 battery test jig
- General purpose micro controller (Arduino Mega) for configuring and communication
- Various Communication cables (Cable #1, #2, #3A, #3B, #3C, #3D, #3E) and Arduino Mega to 
REFDES SPI connections
